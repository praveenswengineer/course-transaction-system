# Course Transaction System
A course information system that allows transactions to be applied using a CICS transaction server to a DB2 data source which holds information on courses.  The system is coded in COBOL and also uses a few Visual C++ frontends.  This was my first project on a CICS server for my CICS course at Durham College.
